# CS440_CH04_Demo_Grootendorst_Erik
For CS440 my justification for choosing the MIT License is simple. I am still a rather undeveloped individual when it comes to my legitimate programming experience. I wanted to choose a license that was most permissive but still accrediting. I believe this is the best way for me to spur quick growth as it promotes aid from the community. At some point down the road I may/will upgrade to a more restrictive license, however for the time being I believe affording others the right to modify, distribute, copy, etc. my code holds greater benefits. By chance if I find myself having created something of substansial value, I will most certainly upgrade the license to a proprietary model. The MIT license also protects my new development with its liability/waranty disclaimer.
